# Run BoB with FireFox or Safari Tech Preview

- You need the last version (>=45) of FF (or Safari tech preview)
- You need a WebComponent Polyfill: [http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/)

## Setup

First you have to get `webcomponents.js`, then:

```html
<script src="webcomponents.min.js"></script>
<script src="../../src/BoB.js"></script>
```

That's all.
